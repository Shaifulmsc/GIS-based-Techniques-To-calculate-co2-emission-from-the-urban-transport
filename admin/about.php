<h3 align="center">The thesis will investigate techniques to calculate the CO2 emissions from transport in urban areas such as cars, 
motorcycles, taxi, bus, electric trains etc. Nowadays, the main cause of air pollution around the world is the emission of greenhouse gases.
Transport is one of the major source of carbon-dioxide emissions.In Europe, almost 75% of greenhouse gas is emitted from vehicles.
To reduce the CO2 emission is the most concerning issue  of many countries. The use of environmentally friendly vehicles
is vital to combat climate change and to make the world a better place to live.Therefore, this thesis aims to calculate the amount of CO2 emitted from different types of vehicles and to 
choose the alternative transport option, which emits less CO2, while traveling to a destination. The approach here is to implement the application of CO2 emission of transport by using OpenStreetMap, Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS), spatial distance tools calculation, spatial and non-spatial data. It will provide an overview of the algorithms and the innovative features that will be used in calculating CO2 emissions. In the framework of this thesis it will be also discusses the system features which make this mechanism useful in a variety  of applications
